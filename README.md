# PlexAmpOffline

Currently unable to extract names of offlined media, except metadata. Important this only works with FLAC files currently.

Designed to run on macOS, compatible with DJ Pro.

Need to implement an ability to extract the name of the Offlined item from the data stored within, /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Plexamp
